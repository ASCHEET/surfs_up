# Investing in Waves and Ice Cream
W. Avy is interested in started a small business in Hawaii that is dedicated to renting surf equipment and providing ice cream treats to tourists.  Understanding the overall good weather of the region, he needs to understand the weather in better detail as how is will affect rentals and ice cream sales.  
Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, the data was filtered by date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June. The temperatures were converted into a list, created a DataFrame from the list, and generated the summary statistics.

## Results 
### Deliverable One: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
The built-in statistical data for the temperatures for June were connected, analyzed and shown below.  It is possible to see that 1,700 data points over 2010 to 2017, are collected for June showing a mean temperature of 75 deg F.  This looks optimistic for ice cream sales for the month of June.
It is important to understand the summer weather for rain or storms as well since another aspect of the business is rental of surfing equipment for tourists, and it is a safe assumption that sales will be slower during periods of rain or precipitation.  Below is a statistical summary of the precipitation information for December.

The built-in statistical data for the temperatures for June were connected, analyzed and shown below.  It is possible to see that 1,700 data points over 2010 to 2017, are collected for June showing a mean temperature of 75 deg F.  This looks optimistic for ice cream sales for the month of June.
